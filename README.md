 A tablet game promoting goal-directed behavior in children with/without cortical visual impairment (CVI).

## Overview

A few months ago, a member of my extended family suffered a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) after a fall accident. As part of the rehabilitation process, the opotmetrist suggested a game in which objects are moving around the screen and they become bigger/generate a sound once the user tap on them. Such a game was not available for Android devices, so I decided to make one from scratch. This github repo is the result of my efforts. 

## Description

This is an interactive game in which different objects are presented one-by-one and move randomly around the screen. The goal of the user is to catch them by tapping on their location. Once they do, the object becomes bigger and a cheerful-rewarding sound is played. Currently there are two categories of objects, fruits and animals. The users can choose which category they want to play with and customize objects' speed of movement (the faster they move the more difficult the game). 

## How to install and run the game

Follow the directory shown below and download the `.apk` file on your device. Once the download is complete, find and tap on the application icon. You should be ready to play!

## Development Specifications
